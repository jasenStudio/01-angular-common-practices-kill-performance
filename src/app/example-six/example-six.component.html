  Neglecting Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation
</h1>
<p>
  Using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in Angular results in slower application
  performance since it compiles the app in the browser. AOT pre-compiles the app
  during the build process, reducing the work that needs to be done at runtime.
</p>
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Problem:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  JIT compilation increases bundle sizes and makes the app slower to load and
  execute.
</p>

<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Solution:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Use AOT compilation to reduce bundle size and improve performance. This can be
  enabled using the â€” aot flag when building the application.
</p>
<br />
<pre>ng build --prod --aot</pre>
<br />
