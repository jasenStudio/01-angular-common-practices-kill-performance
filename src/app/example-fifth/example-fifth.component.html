<h1 class="text-3xl my-5 font-bold">Not Optimizing for Production</h1>
<p>
  Running Angular apps in development mode during production can have
  significant performance implications because Angular performs extra checks and
  logs in development mode.
</p>
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Problem:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Running in development mode increases load times and degrades performance.
</p>

<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Solution:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Always build your app using the production flag to enable optimizations such
  as AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation and minification.
