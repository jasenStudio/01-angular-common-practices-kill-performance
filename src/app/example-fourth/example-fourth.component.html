<h1 class="text-3xl my-5 font-bold">Excessive Use of Watchers</h1>
<p>
  Angularâ€™s two-way data binding can result in numerous watchers being created
  to monitor changes. This can cause significant performance bottlenecks if not
  handled carefully, especially in large applications.
</p>
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Problem:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Too many watchers slow down change detection, as Angular has to evaluate every
  watcher during each cycle.

<br />
<p>
  Avoid creating watchers in complex, nested templates. Reduce binding where
  unnecessary or use detached change detection for specific components.
