<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-2">Unoptimized Third-Party Libraries</h1>
<br />
<p>
  Third-party libraries are widely used to extend functionality. However, not
  all libraries are optimized for performance, and using them carelessly can
  lead to bundle bloat and sluggish app behavior.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Some libraries load unnecessary code, increasing the JavaScript bundle size,
  which impacts initial load times and memory usage.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Only import what you need from libraries. Use tree-shakable imports to
  eliminate unused code.
</p>
<br />
<pre style="font-size: 11px">
 import {{ "{" }}  specificFunction  {{ "}" }}from 'heavy-library';</pre
>

<br />

<p>
  Regularly audit your dependencies and remove unused libraries using tools like
  Webpack Bundle Analyzer.
</p>
